            I started my IT journey in August 2024 after discovering Motion Web
            Academy, and quickly realized this was the right path for me. Over
            13 months of learning, I completed the Frontend track and am now
            focusing on the Backend, building my skills toward becoming a
            confident Full Stack Developer. I enjoy turning ideas into real
            projects, solving challenges, and exploring new technologies.
